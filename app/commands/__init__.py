command_handler.py

This module defines the Command pattern for executing various operations dynamically. 
It includes an abstract base class `Command` for defining executable commands 
and a `CommandHandler` class for managing and executing registered commands.

Classes:
    - Command: Abstract base class for all commands.
    - CommandHandler: Manages the registration and execution of commands.

Usage:
    To create a new command, subclass `Command` and implement the `execute` method.
    Register commands using `CommandHandler.register_command()`, and execute them 
    dynamically using `CommandHandler.execute_command()`.
